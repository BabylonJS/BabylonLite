/**
 * Scene 200 — High-Precision Matrix Jitter (HPM **off**) Parity Test
 *
 * Renders the shared HPM-jitter scene with `useHighPrecisionMatrix: false`
 * and asserts the captured frame matches the committed golden. The golden
 * locks in the F32-only baseline output at world coords ~1e6; any future
 * change that accidentally improves HPM-off precision (e.g. applying
 * floating-origin without the engine flag) will trip this test, surfacing
 * the regression of the explicit substrate boundary.
 *
 * MAD ceiling is 0.1 — the golden is a Lite self-capture (no BJS reference,
 * since HPM is a Lite-specific substrate), so re-runs against the committed
 * golden are essentially bit-identical modulo edge AA rounding.
 *
 * Note: this scene has no Babylon.js reference page (HPM is a
 * Lite-specific substrate). `captureGolden` is intentionally not called —
 * the golden is captured once by running this spec with
 * `BABYLON_LITE_CAPTURE_HPM_GOLDEN=1`, committed, and treated as ground
 * truth thereafter.
