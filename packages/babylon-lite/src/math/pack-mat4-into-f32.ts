/** @internal Pack one Mat4 into a Float32Array upload view at the given float
 *  offset. Source storage may be F32 or F64; this is the only place in the
 *  package where F64→F32 downcast happens for GPU upload. Does not allocate.
 *
 *  When `srcOffsetFloats` is provided, the helper reads 16 floats starting at
 *  `src[srcOffsetFloats]` instead of `src[0]`. This lets thin-instance and
 *  similar packed-slab uploaders walk a `Float32Array | Float64Array` of N×16
 *  values without subarray allocation.
 *
 *  When `offsetXYZ` is provided, the floating-origin offset is subtracted from
 *  the translation column `[12..14]` during pack — used by mesh-world UBO
 *  uploads when the engine has LWR on. The subtraction happens in JavaScript
 *  number precision (F64) BEFORE the implicit F32 store, which is what wins
 *  the precision back: for an F64-backed `Mat4` the result of
 *  `large - large = small` is computed at full F64 precision, then a single
 *  F32 store rounds the small remainder with ample headroom.
 *
 *  Default `offsetXYZ` is a shared `[0, 0, 0]` constant — the three
 *  subtract-zero operations are negligible at runtime, and using one constant
 *  array avoids per-call allocation. View / view-projection / non-mesh-world
 *  uploads omit the parameter and get the original precision-only behaviour.
 *
 *  The 16 element writes are intentionally unrolled to match the style of the
 *  mat4 kernels and avoid an indexable loop in hot paths. Do NOT replace with
 *  `view.set(src, offsetFloats)` — that pattern is the one Task 4.1 audits OUT
 *  outside this single helper. */
