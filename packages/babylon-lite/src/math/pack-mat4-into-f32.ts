/** @internal Pack one Mat4 into a Float32Array upload view at the given float
 *  offset. Source storage may be F32 or F64; this is the only place in the
 *  package where F64→F32 downcast happens for GPU upload. Does not allocate.
 *  Does not perform floating-origin offset subtraction (REQ-UPL-3).
 *
 *  When `srcOffsetFloats` is provided, the helper reads 16 floats starting at
 *  `src[srcOffsetFloats]` instead of `src[0]`. This lets thin-instance and
 *  similar packed-slab uploaders walk a `Float32Array | Float64Array` of N×16
 *  values without subarray allocation. `mat` is widened to the underlying
 *  storage union for these slab callers; the helper still does indexed reads
 *  via `asMat4Storage`, so single-mat4 `Mat4` callers are unchanged.
 *
 *  The 16 element writes are intentionally unrolled to match the style of the
 *  mat4 kernels and avoid an indexable loop in hot paths. Do NOT replace with
 *  `view.set(src, offsetFloats)` — that pattern is the one Task 4.1 audits OUT
 *  outside this single helper. */
