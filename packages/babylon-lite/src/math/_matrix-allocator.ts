/** @internal Lazy-init matrix allocator (GUIDANCE pillar 4 — module-level state
 *  is permitted in lazy-init form because it allocates nothing at import time).
 *
 *  The default allocator returns a fresh `Float32Array(16)`. When the first
 *  HPM-enabled engine is constructed, `createEngine` dynamic-imports
 *  `_mat4-storage-f64.ts` and calls `_setHpmAllocator(allocateF64Mat4)`,
 *  swapping in the F64 backing.
 *
 *  **Constraint:** the allocator is process-global. Pages that mix
 *  HPM and non-HPM engines are unsupported — the second engine silently
 *  inherits the first engine's storage precision. See
 *  `docs/architecture/30-high-precision-matrix.md` for the rationale
 *  (single precision per page).
 *
 *  This pattern replaces the per-engine `_matrixPolicy` field that previously
 *  threaded the allocator through every entity factory and loader. Removing
 *  the field shaves ~300-500 bytes per scene (no more closure captures,
 *  no `LoaderScratch` struct, no `engine.` prefix at every allocation site). */
