// Scene attachment for flow-graph runtimes. Byte-neutral for non-interactivity
// scenes: this module is only pulled into a bundle when something imports it
// (the glTF KHR_interactivity feature, or explicit user code). It drives graphs
// through the scene's generic `onBeforeRender` / `onSceneDispose` seams instead
// of hardcoding a loop in scene-core (GUIDANCE §4c′ — always extensions).
