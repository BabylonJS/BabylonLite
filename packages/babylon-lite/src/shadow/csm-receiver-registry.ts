/**
 * CSM Receiver Registry — lazy wiring of the Standard-material CSM receiver fragment.
 *
 * The Standard shadow fragment (`std-shadow-fragment`) is bundled by every
 * ESM/PCF shadow scene. To keep the cascaded-shadow receiver WGSL out of those
 * bundles, the CSM generator module registers its receiver factory here at
 * generator-creation time (only CSM scenes import the generator), and
 * `std-shadow-fragment` looks it up lazily when it encounters a `"csm"` slot.
 *
 * Zero module-level side effects — safe for tree-shaking. The slot holds `null`
 * until a CSM generator is created.
