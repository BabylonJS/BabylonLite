# Sprites — Implementation Plan

> **Status:** Active plan. PR 1 and PR 3 shipped; PR 2 was absorbed into the PR 1 SpriteRenderer composition model; later sprite phases remain planned.
> **Source spec:** [`architecture/26-sprites.md`](architecture/26-sprites.md)
> **Engine/scene cross-cutting review (David-approved):** [`sprites-scene-engine-changes-review.md`](sprites-scene-engine-changes-review.md)

## Why this document exists

David approved the design but asked that we **land it as a sequence of small PRs, each with visible progress**, rather than one large drop. This document is the agreed sequencing.

It also captures two strategic decisions made before the first PR:

1. We start from a **clean branch off `master`**, not from `lite-2d`.
2. Master already contains an engine/scene decoupling commit (`fe94005 feat(engine): decouple engine from scene; multi-scene rendering via RenderingContext`) — read in detail before scoping PR 1. **PR 0 is effectively done by this commit; sprite PRs build directly on it.** See [Pre-flight outcome](#pre-flight-outcome-fe94005-already-implements-pr-0) below.

---

## Shipped rendering split

Pure-2D and HUD sprites use `SpriteRenderer`, which records a direct swapchain pass with `sampleCount = 1`, no depth attachment, and optional `clear: false` for overlays. This avoids paying scene MSAA cost for texture-alpha sprite edges and keeps pure-2D scenes out of scene/frame-graph code.

The HUD-on-3D case did not land as a separate rendering path or special scene API. It is the PR 1 pure-sprite renderer registered after a scene so it draws on top.

Depth-hosted sprites use `addToScene(scene, layer)` with `depth: "test" | "test-write"`. They become scene renderables and inherit the frame-graph pass target's color format, sample count, depth-stencil format, and target dimensions.

The direct swapchain SpriteRenderer path intentionally does not expose off-screen target attachments. If render-to-texture HUD/GUI sprites become a concrete requirement, revisit either explicit `SpriteRendererOptions` target/depth/resolve attachments or a broader per-context attachment declaration.

---

## Branching strategy

- **`lite-2d` (current branch):** retain locally as a **read-only reference** for porting code. Do not push. Do not merge. Treat it as a working scrapyard.
- **New branch off `master`:** all PRs below land here, one at a time.
- **Each PR is rebased on `master` before merge** to keep history linear.
- **No sprite code is forward-ported wholesale** — each PR rewrites the relevant slice against the spec and pulls only the pieces that fit. This is faster than untangling `lite-2d`'s history and produces smaller, reviewable diffs.

---

## Pre-flight outcome: fe94005 already implements PR 0

David's commit `fe94005 feat(engine): decouple engine from scene; multi-scene rendering via RenderingContext` lands the engine-side scaffold we'd planned for PR 0, with a slightly different (and better) shape than the `EngineRenderer` we proposed in the review doc.

### What's in master today

**`RenderingContext` interface** (`packages/babylon-lite/src/engine/engine.ts`):

```ts
export interface RenderingContext {
    /** Draw calls produced by pre-pass work during `_update` (shadows + pre-passes). */
    _drawCallsPre: number;
    /** Clear color used when this context is the first active one in a frame. */
    clearColor: GPUColorDict;
    /** Per-frame update: beforeRender hooks, shadow + pre-passes, UBO updates.
     *  May submit work into `encoder` and return a new one if it submitted. */
    _update(encoder: GPUCommandEncoder, delta: number): GPUCommandEncoder;
    /** Record main-pass draws into `pass`. Returns draw-call count. */
    _record(pass: GPURenderPassEncoder): number;
}
```

**Engine state:** `_renderingContexts: RenderingContext[]` on `EngineContextInternal`.

**Public API (already exported from `index.ts`):** `registerScene(engine, scene)`, `unregisterScene(engine, scene)`, `startEngine(engine)` (no scene arg), `disposeScene(scene)` (also unregisters).

**Per-frame loop:** engine walks `_renderingContexts`, calls `_update` and `_record` on each using the current command encoder and swapchain view. Scene contexts execute their frame graph; `SpriteRenderer` opens a direct sampleCount=1 sprite pass on the swapchain (`clear: false` uses `loadOp: "load"` for HUD overlays).

**Tests:** all 65 pixel-parity tests pass. Bundle ceilings unchanged.

### Why this shape is better than our planned `EngineRenderer`

| Our planned `EngineRenderer`                          | David's `RenderingContext` (shipped)                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single `render(encoder, dt)` method                   | Split into `_update()` + `_record()` on a registered `RenderingContext`                                 |
| Each renderer opens its own pass                      | Scene contexts execute a frame graph; sprite renderers open only their own direct swapchain sprite pass |
| HUD on top via 2nd registration with `loadOp: "load"` | HUD registers after the scene and sets `clear: false` on its `SpriteRenderer`                           |
| "Clear vs. load" is a registration concern            | "Clear vs. load" is explicit per sprite renderer; frame graph tasks own scene pass load/clear state     |

Sprites just implement `_update` (sprite UBO updates, atlas readiness) + `_record` (sprite draws). HUD-on-3D works because the sprite context is registered second and uses `clear: false`.

### Implications for the rest of the ladder

- **PR 0 is done.** Skipped.
- **`SpriteRenderer` implements `RenderingContext` directly** — no separate `EngineRenderer` interface.
- The review doc's references to `EngineRenderer` should be read as `RenderingContext`. (Will reconcile during PR 1.)
- Public API additions narrow to: `createSpriteRenderer`, `registerSpriteRenderer`, `unregisterSpriteRenderer`, `disposeSpriteRenderer`, plus the `Sprite2DLayer` type. `registerScene`/`unregisterScene`/`startEngine(engine)` already exist.

## PR ladder

Each PR must be small enough to review in one sitting, and **each PR must produce a visible visual deliverable** (a new lab scene, or new behavior in an existing one) so progress can be demoed.

> **PR 0 — Engine registration scaffold** is already shipped in master via commit `fe94005`. See [Pre-flight outcome](#pre-flight-outcome-fe94005-already-implements-pr-0). Skipped from the ladder below.

### ~~PR 0 — Engine registration scaffold~~ _(done in master, fe94005)_

_The `RenderingContext` interface, `_renderingContexts` list, `registerScene`/`unregisterScene`/`startEngine(engine)` public API, the shared-pass per-frame loop, and the deprecated-overload backward compat are all already implemented and tested. All 65 parity tests pass; bundle ceilings unchanged. Original PR 0 scope retained below for reference only:_

- `EngineRenderer` interface: `{ render(encoder: GPUCommandEncoder, deltaMs: number): void; dispose(): void }`
- `engine._registrations: EngineRenderer[]` (internal field)
- `registerScene(engine, scene): Promise<void>` — runs deferred builders, wraps scene as `EngineRenderer`, pushes onto `_registrations`
- `unregisterScene(engine, scene): void`
- `startEngine(engine): Promise<void>` — drops `scene` arg; walks `_registrations` per frame
- **Backward-compat:** keep deprecated `startEngine(engine, scene)` overload that internally calls `registerScene` then `startEngine(engine)` so existing 35 lab scenes keep working byte-identical

**Visual proof:** all existing parity scenes still pass byte-identical (no MAD regression).

**Tests:**

- `register-scene.test.ts` — registration order, idempotency, double-register guard
- `start-engine-no-scene.test.ts` — empty registration list resolves cleanly; multi-registration walks in order
- Existing parity suite (full run) — must remain green
- Existing bundle-size ceilings — must hold

**Why first:** every later PR depends on this. Doing it as a separate, zero-feature PR makes review trivial and revert safe.

---

### PR 1 — Pure 2D sprites _(first PR; first new visual)_ ✅ shipped

**Goal:** sprites on screen with no `Scene` involved at all.

**Scope:**

- `Sprite2DLayer` type + Index API. The pure-2D `SpriteRenderer` path accepts only `depth: "none"`; PR 3 adds the depth-enabled `addToScene` route.
- `SpriteRenderer` + `SpriteRendererOptions`. **`SpriteRenderer` implements `RenderingContext` directly** — provides `_update`, `_record`, `_drawCallsPre`, `clearColor`.
- `createSpriteRenderer(engine, opts)` constructs a `SpriteRenderer`.
- `registerSpriteRenderer(sr)` pushes onto the renderer's engine `_renderingContexts` (same list scenes use).
- `unregisterSpriteRenderer(sr)` removes it.
- `disposeSpriteRenderer(sr)` releases renderer-owned GPU resources.
- WGSL pipeline + atlas/texture binding
- Module: `sprite-renderer.ts`
- Public-API exports

**No new engine surface.** All engine plumbing (`_renderingContexts`, current encoder/swapchain view, context-driven record) is already in master.

**Visual proof:** lab scene `scene50-sprite-grid` is the BJS-validated parity scene that covers PR 1. It exercises the full pure-2D path — atlas, layer, tints, rotation, flipX, and per-sprite size variation — against a BJS `SpriteManager` oracle.

**Tests:**

- `sprite-renderer.test.ts` — create, register, render, unregister, dispose
- Pure-2D bundle-size ceiling (forbids `scene/scene-core.js` entirely from the 2D bundle)
- New parity scene with golden screenshot

**Constraints reminder:** pure-2D ceiling forbids `scene/scene-core.js` — verify with bundle analyzer.

---

### PR 2 — Sprite HUD on top of 3D _(absorbed into PR 1)_ ✅ validated

**Goal:** 3D scene with a static sprite HUD overlay (the canonical game-GUI case).

**Outcome:** no separate PR 2 rendering path shipped. HUD-on-3D is the PR 1 pure-sprite path composed with an existing scene:

- HUD overlays use the same primitives as the pure-2D path: `createSpriteRenderer(engine, { layers, clear: false, clearValue? })` + `registerSpriteRenderer(sr)` after `registerScene(engine, scene)`.
- `onSceneDispose(scene, cb)` exists as a general scene lifecycle helper; scene52 uses it to tie the caller-owned HUD renderer to `disposeScene(scene)`.
- `addToScene` does **not** auto-route HUD layers to an internal `SpriteRenderer`. If a `Sprite2DLayer { depth: "none" }` is added to a scene, deferred scene registration rejects it and tells the caller to use `createSpriteRenderer`. This keeps `registerScene` zero-cost for non-HUD scenes and keeps HUD lifecycle explicit and caller-owned.

**Visual proof:** lab scene `scene52-hud-on-3d` — rotating 3D scene + pure SpriteRenderer HUD overlay; HUD disposal is wired via `onSceneDispose`.

**Tests:**

- `sprite-renderer.test.ts` — covers `createSpriteRenderer` + `registerSpriteRenderer` + `disposeSpriteRenderer` lifecycle.
- `rendering-context-registration.test.ts` — verifies the engine's `_renderingContexts` ordering rule (first context clears, subsequent contexts use `loadOp: "load"`).

---

### PR 3 — Depth-hosted sprites ✅ shipped

**Goal:** sprites participate in 3D depth — pass behind / in front of geometry.

**As-shipped scope:**

- `Sprite2DLayer { depth: "test" | "test-write" }` added through `addToScene` registers a deferred builder. When `registerScene` runs, the layer becomes one scene `Renderable` in `scene._renderables` (`order = 200` transparent direct draw for blended `"test"`; `order = 100` transmissive direct draw after cached opaque meshes for `"test-write"`).
- No new render pass. The renderable participates in the existing frame-graph 3D pass alongside meshes, inheriting the pass color format, sample count, depth-stencil format, and render-target dimensions.
- Depth-hosted sprite renderables use a lazy shared pipeline cache, keyed by target color format, sample count, blend mode, depth-write mode, and depth-stencil format. Bind groups are cached per target-specific pipeline entry.
- The sprite pipeline emits `depthCompare: "less-equal"`, `depthWriteEnabled: true|false` driven by the `depth` value; the per-instance Z (slot [10]) is consumed by the depth test.

**Visual proof:** lab scene `scene53-depth-hosted-sprites` — sprites partially occluded by 3D meshes.

**Tests:**

- `sprite-depth-hosted-routing.test.ts` — verifies `addToScene` registers deferred depth-hosted builders, `registerScene` routes `"test"` / `"test-write"` to `scene._renderables` with the correct bucket/order metadata, target-specific formats/dimensions are honored, bind groups stay pipeline-compatible, disposal runs through `disposeScene`, and `depth: "none"` rejects during scene registration with a message that points callers to `SpriteRenderer`.

---

### PR 4 — Billboards (anchored / camera-facing)

**Goal:** dense camera-facing sprites in 3D — trees, particles, UI markers.

**Scope:**

- Port `BillboardSpriteSystem` from `lite-2d` reference, reshaped to live cleanly under the new `SpriteRenderer` / `_deferredBuild` model (or as its own `EngineRenderer` if cleaner — TBD during PR)
- Reuse existing `_sprite3dSceneUBO` / `_anchoredSceneUBO` machinery already on `SceneContextInternal`
- Variants: anchored to a transform vs. world-positioned

**Visual proof:** new lab scene `scene54-billboards` — a field of camera-facing sprites that always face the camera.

**Tests:**

- `billboard-system.test.ts`
- Parity scene with golden screenshot from a fixed camera angle
- Camera-rotation test (sprites stay facing camera)

**Note:** existing `billboard-sprite-system` and `anchored-sprite-layer` branches in `scene-core.ts` should be **rationalized/renamed** under the unified `sprite-2d-layer` discriminator if it makes sense; otherwise kept distinct. Decision deferred to PR 4 author after PRs 1–3 prove the new model.

---

### PR 5 — Sprite picking

**Goal:** clicking a sprite returns which sprite was hit.

**Scope:**

- CPU-side hit-test: ray vs. screen-space quads for HUD sprites (depth:"none"), ray vs. world-space quads for depth-hosted/billboard sprites
- Hooks into existing engine pointer events
- Returns `(layer, spriteIndex)` initially; `Sprite2DHandle` integration comes in PR 6

**Visual proof:** new lab scene `scene55-sprite-picking` — click a sprite, log/highlight it.

**Tests:**

- `sprite-picking.test.ts` — synthetic click coordinates, expected hit results
- Parity scene (visual highlight on click) — may need event-driven golden capture

**Why before handles:** handles need picking as a foundation; doing picking standalone keeps PR 5 small.

---

### PR 6 — Sprite handles _(observable + parentable identity)_

**Goal:** the `Sprite2DHandle` / `BillboardSpriteHandle` API — observable fields, stable id, parenting — so callers don't mutate index arrays directly.

**Scope:**

- `Sprite2DHandle` in `sprite/sprite-2d-handle.ts` (separately importable so index-only scenes don't pull handle code — bundle ceiling enforces this)
- `addSprite2D(layer, init): Sprite2DHandle` / `updateSprite2D(handle, patch)` / `removeSprite2D(handle)`
- Same for billboards: `addBillboardSprite` / `updateBillboardSprite` / `removeBillboardSprite` / `setBillboardSpriteFrame`
- Parenting: handles can have a parent (mesh, transform node, another sprite handle)
- PR 5's picking returns handles when the handle module is loaded, falls back to `(layer, index)` when not

**Visual proof:** new lab scene `scene56-sprite-handles` — drag sprites around the screen using handles + picking; demonstrate parenting (sprite follows a moving 3D mesh).

**Tests:**

- `sprite-2d-handle.test.ts` — create/update/remove, observable field notifications, stable id across reorders
- `sprite-handle-parenting.test.ts` — handle follows parent transform
- Bundle-size ceiling: index-only scenes do not include `sprite-2d-handle.js`

---

## Sequencing rationale

- **PR 0** is the only invisible PR. Everything else produces a screenshot-deliverable.
- **PRs 1 → 2 → 3** climb the rendering complexity ladder: no scene → scene + HUD overlay → scene with depth interaction. Each adds exactly one new concern.
- **PR 4** ports the existing billboard work into the proven new shape.
- **PRs 5 → 6** layer interaction on top of rendering, in dependency order (picking before handles).
- **No PR depends on a future PR.** Each can be reverted independently if needed.

---

## Cross-cutting reminders

These apply to every PR:

- **No side-effect imports.** Add explicit imports for any prototype-augmented method.
- **No allocations in the render loop.** Use scratch buffers; verify with perf tests (user-run only).
- **Backward compatibility** of public API across PRs (the deprecated `startEngine(engine, scene)` overload from PR 0 stays through at least PR 6).
- **Tree-shaking ceilings** — pure-2D bundle forbids `scene/scene-core.js`; index-only scenes forbid `sprite-2d-handle.js`. Each PR adds/maintains the relevant ceiling test.
- **Parity tests must stay green** at every PR boundary. No MAD regression. No golden reference changes without explicit user approval.

---

## Open items

- **Branch name** for the new clean branch off `master` — suggest `lite-sprites` or `lite-2d`. User's choice.
- **PR 4 — keep or unify branches?** Decide whether `anchored-sprite-layer` / `billboard-sprite-system` discriminators get unified under `sprite-2d-layer` or stay distinct. Defer to PR 4 author.
- **Reconcile `sprites-scene-engine-changes-review.md`** with master's actual `RenderingContext` shape (review doc references the older `EngineRenderer` proposal). Cleanup task during PR 1.
